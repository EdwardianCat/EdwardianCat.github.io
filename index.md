# About Me
Hey. Howdy. How ya doin. My name's Maya and I am a student at University School of Nashville. I like to read books on gay eldritch monstrosities, talk Dr. Who, and flirt with dragons and mob bosses in Dungeons and Dragons. When I'm not being cool you can find me listening to fiction podcasts and drawing.
