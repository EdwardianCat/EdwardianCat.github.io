Woah, cool blender tool. My plan is to create a button in blender that will populate the screen with a bunch of sharks when pressed. These sharks will have their own programmed swimming physics. My first step is to model the shark object and then rig it. Then, I will create the physics for it so that it will wiggle and swim around. This will make me very happy. Next, I will create a shortcut that will generate a shark every time you press it. If possible, I want to be able to have that button turn any water you have going on into sharks. I just want so many sharks.

Currently, I'm in the process of modeling the shark and making it into an object I can easily access in blender. Current roadblock is that I have no idea how blender works but I am having a GREAT time.
